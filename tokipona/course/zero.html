        <h2>foreword</h2>
        <p>welcome to this toki pona course! i started thinking about this course all the way in august 2020, but i never got around to fully making it. hopefully, by putting it up on a website, i'll actually get around to making it :p</p>
        <p>i wanted to make a course that really helps you get into toki pona - a course not just for beginners, but also for those who might already know the basic vocab/grammar and want more practice listening or translating.</p>
        <p>so i've tried to include more elaboration, mnemonics and tips for vocab, extra short stories, listening excercises, and other cool stuff i think is worth learning about. i'll even include flashcards for vocab!</p>
        <p>feel free to take this slow - do the exercises more than once, or skip any you don't like. listen multiple times, rewatch videos, do a few courses at the same time. but either way, i hope this will help you along your toki pona journey!</p>

        <h2>what is toki pona?</h2>
        <p>every single course explains this, but anyways, toki pona is a constructed language by canadian linguist sonja lang, first published in 2001. it's generally said to have ~120 <small>(depending on how you count)</small> words and is designed to simplify everything to its basic elements.</p>
        <p>some resources to know toki pona better!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtu.be/eLn6LC1RpAo" target="_blank">conlang critic: toki pona</a> by jan misali, which is a really good video about toki pona as a language.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona" target="_blank">the toki pona wikipedia page</a>, which contains quite a bit of info, if you're the kind to read wikipedia pages.</li>
          <li><a href="https://discord.gg/9HpEqrP4JJ" target="_blank">ma pona pi toki pona</a>, a great toki pona discord server. if you're considering learning, definitely join.</li>

        <h2>why learn toki pona?</h2>
        <p>now, this is a great question.</p>
        <p>toki pona is a really good language, yes, but there are so many other languages in the world. so why toki pona?</p>
        <p>personally, i chose toki pona because the community sounded fascinating. i watched jan misali's video about it and heard the love and passion in his voice and checked out the toki pona discord server and by god, it is such an amazing place.</p>
        <p>other reasons i love toki pona include 1) it's easy 2) simplify your thoughts! 3) it's easy to pronounce 4) it's so creative and expressive! since there's only a limited number of words, you need to make connections to understand or say something. 5) sonja is a really good person :)</p>
        <p>toki pona is great! i hope you'll enjoy my courses :D</p>

        <h2>final words!</h2>
        <p>by the end of this course, you’ll know all the pu vocab (ie. all those in the official book), all the grammar, and basically everything you’ll need to get talking. there’ll also be an extra section at the end, which covers some alternative usages and a few non-pu words commonly used in the ma pona pi toki pona discord server. (however, note that other communities might not use these - i'll include extra notes when we get to it.)</p>
        <p>remember, nothing is set in stone! memorising certain phrases might speed up your learning, but don't focus too much on them. the same phrase can mean something completely different when used in a different context.</p>
        <p>that's all for lesson zero. if you're ready, let's dive right in!</p>
