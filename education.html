        <h2>ableism</h2>
        <p>ableism is easily the most common form of discrimination around, yet rarely anyone pays attention to it. words such as <span class="spoiler">stupid</span> and <span class="spoiler">insane</span> might sound fine to you, but really, they are Extremely Bad. i urge you to drop them from your vocabulary.</p>
