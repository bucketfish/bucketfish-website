        <h2>what i'm doing now</h2>
        <p>(this is a /now page. if you have a site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">you should make one too!</a>)</p>
        <p>updated 10 august 2022.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box content-box" id="now">
        <h2>gamedev</h2>
        <p>box arena box arena! although no development is actively going on at the moment. will be released by the end of 2022. i also have a backlog of games i want to finish making afterwards, so maybe i'll be packed in 2023?</p>
        <p>there are a few gamedev stuff i'm helping with various people, so i'll probably focus on those for now.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>writing</h2>
        <p>nothing going on at the moment! i have half a mind to finish a fanfiction i've been working on and off, but seems unlikely.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>crafts</h2>
        <p>this is a new section of my /now page, but i realise i am doing a lot of crafts lately.</p>
        <p>recently got into wire jewelry, and i'm considering making a small shop/commission business, or at least keeping a log of stuff i've made on this website somewhere soon :)</p>
        <p>and i also have wayy too many crochet wips.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>content consuming</h2>
        <p>quite a lot of hours into hades! i still haven't gotten a complete run yet. maybe i am actually bad at games.</p>
        <p>i finished reading ash by malinda lo recently (it's SO good), and i'm currently reading grim (short story collection). i am enjoying it a lot!</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>learning</h2>
        <p>i stopped learning esperanto again oops. no time or motivation. so i am not really learning anything actively right now. but experimenting a lot with crafts :)</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>social</h2>
        <p>discord srever and twitter are both going pretty well!</p>
        <p>opened a public-private irl instagram recently to allow my irls to catch on me more easily, we'll see how that goes :)</p>
