        <h2>writing</h2>
        <p>nothing going on at the moment! school is taking up too much of my life :(</p>

        <h2>content consuming</h2>
        <p>i recently got hades and it's SO good. as of writing this i have less than an hour playtime but i'm planning to play more as soon as i finish writing. it's so smooth it's so good! when i have free time i'll probably be playing this.</p>

        <h2>learning</h2>
        <p>i've picked up esperanto on duolingo again for fun. other than that, school is really really taking up all of my life haha......</p>
