      <div class="box content-box" id="now">
        <h2>gamedev</h2>
        <p>currently focusing on gamedev, namely box arena and a bit of esteria on the side.</p>
        <p>originally planned to finish box arena in june, but that seems difficult, so release will be ideally before september. esteria feels more like a long-term dream game, so i have no idea how much i'll get out of that.</p>

        <h2>writing</h2>
        <p>been meaning to get back into songwriting and poetry, although it seems unlikely at the moment. i'm loving <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/" target='_blank'>ink</a> a lot though, and i really want to do more with it!</p>
        <p>meanwhile, my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/bucketfish" target="_blank">tinyletter</a> is getting my attention. near-monthly posts, maybe?</p>
