        <h2>gamedev</h2>
        <p>box arena's release goal is by the end of this year. i also have plans for going back to christmas lights, eventually, and then esteria, too.</p>
        <p>there are no more side projects i'm distracted by except for possibly the upcoming ludum dare 51, which i might not participate in due to exams. and maybe something for halloween, then!</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>writing</h2>
        <p>surprisingly, i am still working occasionally on the fanfiction. i don't plan to share it here anytime, but wow it's interesting. i really want to do more writing. maybe more choose-your-own-adventure stuff, akin to dreams of cat. we will see.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>crafts</h2>
        <p>recently got into wire jewelry, and i'm considering making a small shop/commission business, or at least keeping a log of stuff i've made on this website somewhere soon :)</p>
        <p>i also have a sewing machine now! don't really have time to do much with it tho.</p>
        <p>and (hopefully) finishing up a few crochet projects in my free time.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>content consuming</h2>
        <p>i got one run on hades!! i got it!!! i will get more!!!</p>
        <p>currently reading circe by madeline miller. i really quite enjoy the writing style.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>learning</h2>
        <p>nothing actively. maybe a little tarot?</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>social</h2>
        <p>discord server and twitter are both going pretty well!</p>
        <p>opened a public-private irl instagram recently to allow my irls to catch on me more easily, we'll see how that goes :)</p>
