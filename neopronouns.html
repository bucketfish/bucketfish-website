          <h1>about neopronouns</h1>
          <p>the big question: what are those pronouns you listed? fae, ae, rae?</p>
          <p>those are called neopronouns, aka pronouns other than the 'standard' she/he/they/it, aka made-up pronouns. they're pretty common in the world of lgbt+.</p>
          <p>some of the most popular neopronouns include <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/xe" target="_blank">xe/xem</a>, <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/vi/vim" target="_blank">vi/vim</a>, and fae/faer.</p>
          <p>there are links in this page to <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/" target="_blank">en.pronouns.page</a>, which is a neat website that teaches about neopronouns.</p>
          <hr/>

          <p>the neopronouns that i use are fae/faer, ae/aer, and rae/ren/res, in no particular order.</p>
          <p><a href="https://en.pronouns.page/fae/faer" target="_blank">fae/faer(/faer/faers/faerself)</a> is a pretty common one. this neopronoun sounds similar to genders such as genderfae or genderfaer, or remind of fae otherkin, i do not identify as any of those, but i do hold respect for them and i think they're all super valid! </p>
          <p><a href="https://en.pronouns.page/ae/aer" target="_blank">ae/aer(/aer/aers/aerself)</a> is another set of neopronouns that i really like. nothing else to say, it's good.</p>
          <p><a href="https://en.pronouns.page/rae/ren/res/res/renself" target="_blank">rae/ren(/res/res/renself)</a> is inspired by waso lojeki. it's amazing and thank you!</p>
          <hr/>

          <p>now for the final question: what do you have to do with this?</p>
          <p>these are my pronouns, that is, it'd be nice if people used them. but i know that it can be difficult, and she/her and they/them are also pronouns i like and use, so just, use any that you want :) but if you do use my neopronouns that'd be super cool!</p>
