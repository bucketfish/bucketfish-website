        <h2>one month, and many thiings • 20.7.2021</h2>
        <p>two days ago marked one month of development on <a href="mystuff/christmaslights.html">christmas lights!</a>! and there's a page created for that now, too. if i carry on with this for two more months i'll allow myself to make a discord server dedicated to this and start collecting a following, but that'll also be around exam period, so who knows. but for now please go play the demo and tell me everything :)</p>
        <p>i also finally claimed my github students free domain for a year at bucketfish.me! i don't know what i'll do to it after a year, but hopefully i can keep using it, but probably not. we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, i guess.</p>
        <p>anyways, i guess that's it for now. i'm super happy about my progress on christmas lights, and i don't have anything anywhere else, so - see you!</p>

        <h2>school, again, and many updates • 3.7.2021</h2>
        <p>good morning! it's night right now. school's been in for a week and i'm absolutely drained and extremely tired and i feel like i completely forgot how to interact with others on anywhere other than discord, which is quite fascinating.</p>
        <p>a few updates:
        <ul>
          <li>new game dev project! it's called 'christmas lights'. a small platformer about lights. it's halfway through and i plan to have a demo up by maybe the end of the year, but realistically i'll be abandoning it in a few weeks. which brings me to</li>
          <li>i got a twitter! <a href="https://twitter.com/bucketfish_" target="_blank">@bucketfish_</a>. mostly game updates, but also random thoughts. haven't thought about what i'll do with it yet but most of the good creators are there so might as well.</li>
          <li>thinking of making an rss feed. it would be cool! let me know thoughts</li>
          <li>if you recall i had 'fish.69.mu' domain temporarily. i technically can have it back now but it's quite a hassle and i'd rather just stick with neocities. yee</li>
          <li>ma pona webring! a great place. check out the other things there too. see front page</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>that is all. have a good day! i hope to have on too.</p>
