          <strong>site revamp in progress! • 19.11.2021</strong>
          <p>i almost thought i lost my enjoyment of coding, but i guess it just stems from not having the right outlet. i'm currently working on the site revamp and <em>wow</em>, i want to keep doing this!</p>
          <p>i have a good bunch of ideas for what to include next on the website and i think i'll take a few days to finish it all, but for now i'll just put whatever i have here. it's so epic!</p>
          <p>still keeping that rainbow theme, yes, but now in dark mode :)</p>
          <p>AH i forgot i also need to make sure it's okay on mobile. that's a small pain.</p>
          <p>perhaps when my domain runs out i'll move back to fish.69.mu,,,,,, who knows?</p>

          <strong>sunset-shaped • 7.9.2021</strong>
          <p>wow. so. yesterday i published <a href="https://bucketfish.itch.io/sunset-shaped" target="_blank">sunset-shaped</a>, my newest game for a jam. and like. wow! the response has been... it's so cool. people are enjoying it. people are speedrunning it. it's wild.</p>
          <p>i keep riding that wave and sharing it to places. not sure if that's a great idea, but i don't know. it's still doing super well - the second day's stats are higher than the first >.></p>
          <p>i'm very proud of it? there's so much. so many decisions made while making the game. i'm so proud of the player-touching-wall sound effect specifically.</p>
          <p>please check it out? i really should study, my exams are coming up real soon, yet,,,,</p>
          <p>oh well. it was fun :)</p>

          <strong>one month, and many things • 20.7.2021</strong>
          <p>two days ago marked one month of development on <a href="mystuff/christmaslights.html">christmas lights!</a>! and there's a page created for that now, too. if i carry on with this for two more months i'll allow myself to make a discord server dedicated to this and start collecting a following, but that'll also be around exam period, so who knows. but for now please go play the demo and tell me everything :)</p>
          <p>i also finally claimed my github students free domain for a year at bucketfish.me! i don't know what i'll do to it after a year, but hopefully i can keep using it, but probably not. we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, i guess.</p>
          <p>anyways, i guess that's it for now. i'm super happy about my progress on christmas lights, and i don't have anything anywhere else, so - see you!</p>

          <strong>school, again, and many updates • 3.7.2021</strong>
          <p>good morning! it's night right now. school's been in for a week and i'm absolutely drained and extremely tired and i feel like i completely forgot how to interact with others on anywhere other than discord, which is quite fascinating.</p>
          <p>a few updates:
            <ul>
              <li>new game dev project! it's called 'christmas lights'. a small platformer about lights. it's halfway through and i plan to have a demo up by maybe the end of the year, but realistically i'll be abandoning it in a few weeks. which brings me to</li>
              <li>i got a twitter! <a href="https://twitter.com/bucketfish_" target="_blank">@bucketfish_</a>. mostly game updates, but also random thoughts. haven't thought about what i'll do with it yet but most of the good creators are there so might as well.</li>
              <li>thinking of making an rss feed. it would be cool! let me know thoughts</li>
              <li>if you recall i had 'fish.69.mu' domain temporarily. i technically can have it back now but it's quite a hassle and i'd rather just stick with neocities. yee</li>
              <li>ma pona webring! a great place. check out the other things there too. see front page</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>that is all. have a good day! i hope to have on too.</p>
